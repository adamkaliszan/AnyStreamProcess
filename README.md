Tools prof investigating the systems with non-poisson bitrth and death processes.

Software consists of
* simulators
* analytical algorithms implementation
* visualization module (model of the system and charts)
* storege module (export to xlsx or gnuplot files)

Software can investigate following systems:
* Full Availability Group without buffer
* Limited Availability Group without buffer
* FAG and LAG with continuos or discrette buffer

Time intervalls between the events can be described by following distributions:
* Poisson
* Uniform
* Gamma
* Pareto
* Normal (negative values are truncated)
